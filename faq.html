                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Convoy 1943 is an ambitious addon for Stormworks: Build and Rescue, designed to simulate naval convoy battles and operations during World War II, specifically focusing on the Battle of the Atlantic. It features AI-driven convoys, hostile U-boats and aircraft, player-controllable escort vessels, and various simulated wartime systems.</p>

                        <p>Currently, Convoy 1943 is primarily available during live, organized events. There is no public code release at this time. To participate in future events, please join the Endo Events Discord server (link on the main page) for announcements and details.</p>

                        <p>Players can take command of various escort vessels, such as the Flower-class Corvette (fully upgraded). The addon also supports spawning and controlling certain aircraft for specific roles. Details on available player-controlled escorts can be found on the <a href="escorts.html" class="underline hover:text-white">Escorts page</a>.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The primary objectives revolve around convoy operations. As an escort, your main goal is to protect AI merchant convoys from U-boat and air attacks. If playing as an Axis U-boat (during specific event scenarios), your objective would be to sink Allied shipping. The addon also features emergent gameplay around strategic sector control. See the <a href="missions.html" class="underline hover:text-white">Missions page</a> for more details on gameplay loops.</p>

                        <p>Yes, players can typically join either the "Sawyer Alliance" (Allies) or the "Meier Isles" (Axis) forces during events. This allows for team-based gameplay and objectives.</p>

                        <p><strong>Is it permitted for me to design and build a smaller scale replica of submarines/ships/aircraft for the event that follow all specifications?

                        <p>Builds for non-official events are only required to meet speed/diving speed/turning speed and WWII Design Theme. I don't have an exact spec yet for the above but basically realistic behavior. And of course optimized as possible.</p>

                        <p><strong>What speed do the torpedoes run at?</strong></p>
                        <p>Last I checked 20kts but due to testing they have been tweaked weekly.</p>
                        <p><strong>Do torpedos only fire straight out from the bow?</strong></p>
                        <p>Torpedos currently fire in a direction based on paint block locations (although I haven't tested side paint blocks or paint blocks angled - I think currently paint blocks facing bow or aft).</p>
                        <p><strong>Can I feed angles from the periscope to shoot side to side or directly aft?</strong></p>
                        <p>Currently you can feed an angle offset, I haven't messed with the new feature yet but X64 has added a system to determine an angle setting for their uboat.</p>
                        <p><strong>Can I set a depth for them to run at?</strong></p>
                        <p>Currently torpedos run at a shallow depth in order for look outs to have a chance of seeing torpedo wakes - this is not likely to change or be editable.</p>

                        <p><strong>How can I test the functionality of my submarines with the mod parts? Do I have to join the server every time in order to test it?</strong></p>
                        <p>A mod pack is available for installing addons (hydrophone, torpedo system etc) but currently the addon is not available for download so you will not be able to test working systems. Currently addons are not all available anyway as we're still testing and changing things. As for mod pack you will find it at this link: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3466807589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline hover:text-white">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3466807589</a></p>

                        <p>Later on it's possible I'll be able to setup a server for you to test builds during the week.</p>

                        <p>Currently in testing we've run 4 convoy ships along with 3 player vehicles not noticing any more lag than usual. Depending on the number of player vehicles, I don't think there will be more than 4 convoy ships in play at a single time. Upcoming addon updates are planned to keep gameplay flow going by replacing convoy ships and player ships to simulate a larger convoy - this update has not been started yet.</p>

                        <p>I started out checking out dedicated servers early on but even mid priced dedicated servers caused jittering and lag. As for a in house server - I don't have the funds for a new pc and the pc I attempted to run a dedicated server was 14 years old and would fall behind and drop TPS. Current the game is being hosted on a steam account on a 3900x AMD 64 gigs ram, ssd and Nivida 4060ti.</p>

                        <p>Currently I think we've tested with a max of 14 players but that was early on and I believe ships and code are more optimized now. So far we have not reached a 14 players since then - so it is unknown how many players we can actually run without gameplay falling apart. So max number of players in events is to be determined...</p>
